# stock-analysis (VBA Challenge)
Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to refactor existing stock analysis code to in order for it to run faster (i.e., more efficiently). 
Results
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
The following pictures show the stock performance 12 stocks in years 2017 and 2018. According to the table, 2017 saw significantly more positive stock growth then 2018.

With respect to refactoring, the edited code performed the same job much faster than the original code. In 2017 and 2018, the original code ran in 0.64 and 0.66 seconds, respectively. The refactored code ran in 0.10 and 0.09 seconds for 2017 and 2018, respectively.

The reason for the increase in efficiently was due to the use of stragetic for loops and conditionals.
